### Simple Calculator Overview

The Simple Calculator program is a basic Python application designed to perform essential arithmetic operations. It allows users to input two numbers and choose an operationâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The calculator then performs the selected operation and displays the result.

#### Key Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program prompts the user step-by-step to enter numbers and select the desired operation.
- **Four Core Operations**:
  - **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers.
  - **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  - **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers.
  - **Division (/)**: Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.
- **Error Handling**: The program ensures that inputs are valid numbers and handles division by zero gracefully.
- **Loop for Multiple Calculations**: After displaying the result, the program asks the user if they want to perform another calculation, allowing multiple operations without restarting the program.

#### Usage:
- **Input**: The user is prompted to enter two numeric values.
- **Operation Selection**: The user chooses an operation from the menu options (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- **Result Display**: The calculator performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
- **Exit or Continue**: The user can choose to either perform another calculation or exit the program.

This simple calculator is ideal for basic arithmetic tasks, offering a straightforward and efficient way to perform calculations.
